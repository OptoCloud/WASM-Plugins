# WASM Plugins

This is a project to test the feasibility of using WebAssembly as mods for games.

This makes it possible to write mods in any language that compiles to WebAssembly, such as Rust, C, C++, Go, C#, etc...

It also makes it possible to run mods in a sandboxed environment, so that mods can't access the host system which makes it safer to run mods.

I'm doing this just for fun :)
